- [ ] Use builder patterns for complex object construction
- [ ] Implement fluent interfaces where appropriate

```dart
// Good: Clear, semantic naming with types
class WellnessEntryBuilder {
  WellnessEntry buildSVTEpisode({
    required DateTime timestamp,
    required Duration episodeDuration,
    String? triggerNotes,
  }) { /* ... */ }
}

// Good: Self-documenting interfaces
abstract class HealthDataRepository {

  Future<AnalyticsData> calculateMonthlyStats(int year, int month);
}
```

**REQ-039: AI-Friendly Documentation Standards**

```dart
/// Calculates SVT episode patterns over a specified time period.
/// 
/// This method analyzes SVT episodes to identify:
/// - Most common occurrence times
/// - Average episode duration
/// - Frequency patterns by day of week
/// 
/// **Performance**: O(n) where n is number of entries in date range
/// **Memory**: Uses streaming processing for datasets >1000 entries
/// 
/// [dateRange] The time period to analyze
/// [includeIncomplete] Whether to include episodes without duration data
/// 
/// Returns [SVTPatternAnalysis] containing statistical insights
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final analysis = await analyzer.calculateSVTPatterns(
///   DateRange.lastMonth(),
///   includeIncomplete: false,
/// );
/// print('Average duration: ${analysis.averageDuration}');
/// ```
Future<SVTPatternAnalysis> calculateSVTPatterns(
  DateRange dateRange, {
