## 🚀 Technical Achievement: Critical Bug Resolution

### The Challenge
During development, we encountered a critical data persistence bug where all wellness entries would disappear after the app was closed and reopened. This was a blocking issue for real-world usage.

### Root Cause Analysis
Through systematic debugging, we identified that the issue was in the Hive NoSQL database implementation:
- Hive stored data as `Map<dynamic, dynamic>`
- Our code expected `Map<String, dynamic>`
- Type casting failures caused all entries to be marked as corrupted and skipped

### Strategic Solution
Rather than patching the type casting issue, we made a strategic decision to migrate from Hive to SQLite:

**Why SQLite was the better choice:**
- ✅ **Type Safety**: SQL schema enforces proper data types
- ✅ **Reliability**: Battle-tested with ACID compliance
- ✅ **Debugging**: SQL queries are transparent and debuggable
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized for mobile applications
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Better support for complex queries and relationships

### Implementation
- Created `SQLiteLocalDataSource` with proper schema design
- Maintained existing `LocalDataSource` interface for clean architecture
- Added data migration utilities for future use
- Validated solution with comprehensive testing

### Result
✅ **Complete resolution** - App now reliably persists data across sessions  
✅ **Improved architecture** - More robust and maintainable data layer  
✅ **Enhanced debugging** - Clear visibility into data operations  
✅ **Production ready** - Validated reliability for real-world usage  

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Clean Architecture Implementation
```
├── presentation/     # UI components, screens, widgets
├── domain/          # Business logic, entities, repositories
├── data/            # Data sources, repositories, services
└── core/            # Utilities, constants, themes
```

### Key Design Patterns
